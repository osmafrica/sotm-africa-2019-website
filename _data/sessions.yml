  description: "In 2018, Open Cities Africa was launched and implemented in 12 cities in Sub-Saharan Africa to engage local government, civil society, and the private sector to develop the geospatial information necessary to meet urban resilience, and disaster risk management challenges. In this session, the OpenDRI team from the World Bank, coordinators of the project, will present an overview of the Open Cities methodology, and speak to the importance of open data to support decision making in vulnerable countries. Representatives from each of our 12 cities will present a short ignite talk showcasing their Open Cities journey. Talks will cover the following thematic areas; government stakeholder engagement, educational engagement, community engagement, data for decision making, and the future of the initiative (or, how the project has evolved since inception). Ignite talks will be followed by a short poster session, where conference attendees will have time to engage with city implementation teams to find out more about each individual project."

    **Lightning talks: Agriculture**
      - Open data and agricultural start ups (Nako kofele martin alain, Expanding Horizon, Cameroon) 

          Africa's future cannot be decided without the narrative of agriculture, youths and ICT  being changed. 
          integrating scientific methods to an age long agrarian practice that has mostly been traditionally carried out, is directly changing the outcome in terms of production. the making and putting of such skills and innovation at the disposal of young people of involved in agric start ups is capital in changing the out put when it comes to food puducton, food security and  job creation.
          open data and mapping in the 21st century are the instruments needed to make evidence based decision, that will have long term impact and sucess for start ups. Important aspects of business development, such as market survey, feasibility, are all possible thanks to open data and mapping.

      - Accessing agricultural data in rural communities for Sustainable Livelihood (Eyongetta Njieassam, GYSSL, Cameroon)

          Improving agricultural production needs access to agricultural data by rural farmers. rural farmers in this part of the globe have gone for decades with no credible data on new models for Sustainable agriculture. thishas limit the to traditional methods which has low yields and high production cost. Rural communities face a neglect when it come to data infrastructure. data being a blue print for optimum performance out put in our research activities needs to be given an open access to rural farmers in order to improve their yields and reduce the cost of agricultural production. this will there code meets with the SDG 1,2&3 of the UN by 2030 and help transform livelihood

      - Community-led data collection using Open Data Kit for surveillance of animal African trypanosomiasis in Shimba hills, Kenya (Benard Kulohoma, University of Nairobi, Kenya)

          Trypanocide non-susceptibility remains a huge challenge in the management of animal African trypanosomiasis. Paucity of data on the prevalence of multi-drug non-susceptible trypanosomes has greatly hindered optimal veterinary management practices. Our study provides proof of concept for the viability of using smart mobile phone Apps to remotely collect reliable large-scale information from smallholder farmers and veterinary health care givers in resource poor settings. These datasets can be reliably collated remotely, analysed, and the findings can inform policies that improve farming practices and economic wellbeing while restricting widespread multi-drug resistance. Moreover, this strategy can be used to monitor and manage other infectious diseases in other rural, resource poor settings.

      - Implication des femmes et jeunes filles a la production des données ouvertes à Boke  (BARRY Mamadou Bella, GeoSynapse, Guinee)

        C’ est de parler du rôle des Girlsmap dans la production des données ouverte à Boké cela s’intègre dans le renforcement  des capacités des femmes et jeunes filles dans l’usage des technologies de l’information pour le développement en Guinée.ma présentation s’aligne dans le genre. Le lien entre le thème de la conférence et ma présentation est que grâce à ces séance que j’organise des vies ont été transformés d’où aujourd’hui  ces femmes et jeunes filles ont pris confiances en elles car elles  sont d’avantages motivées et impliquées dans la production des données ouverts pour la gestion de la ville  qui contribue au bien d’être de la population.

      - L’initiative Girlsmap au Togo et en Afrique  (AKOUETE Ata Franck, OSM Togo, Togo)

        Girlsmap est une initiative  lancée en 2018 par OSM Togo en vue  d’accroître via des activités de sensibilisation et de formation la proportion de femmes dans les différentes communautés OSM. Cette présentation est un extrait de cette initiative au Togo et dans d’autres pays d’Afrique. Le nombre de contributeurs OSM augmente chaque année dans le monde. Cependant, l’univers OSM regorge moins de contributrices que de contributeurs dans les différentes communautés pays surtout celles  d’Afrique. C’est pourquoi, OSM Togo, soucieux de réduire la fracture numérique liée au genre dans le monde OSM et d’accroitre le nombre de femmes dans sa communauté a initié en 2018, la première initiative de formation en cartographie numérique OSM qui s’adresse uniquement aux filles. Loin de s’arrêter au Togo, cette initiative est devenue un modèle et a été répliquée par plusieurs pays de la sous-région comme le Benin, la côte d’ivoire, Guinée et se fut annoncée dans d’autres pays comme le Mali ainsi que le Burundi. Cette présentation cadre bien avec le thème de cette conférence car elle permet d’impacter la vie numérique des filles via la cartographie numérique openstreetmap.

  description: |
    Core datasets and maps are vital to helping Red Cross staff and volunteers situate their teams and respond within communities during epidemics. Information about features like road networks, health infrastructure, climate patterns, disease incidence, population density, and health behaviors can be valuable inputs for response teams to analyze in order to better understand the environment in which an outbreak has taken place.

    As one component of the Community-Based Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention Project (CP3), a program funded by USAID, the Red Cross works with country-level stakeholders to identify high-priority datasets that are essential in a disaster situation or health emergency, and also useful for immediate purposes. In countries participating in this program, the National Societies work to locate, validate, and openly release this information with the permission of its owners, allowing maps to be made that will give responders information that will lead to effective decision-making. In addition, staff and volunteers work to improve data literacy and awareness surrounding this information. These efforts help to improve what we call “Data Readiness”: the ability of an organization to utilize data during a response for situational awareness, planning, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.

    In this presentation, we will walk you through our work and what “Data Readiness” activities look like when Red Cross staff and volunteers work alongside their communities. Using open source data, maps, and tools, we want National Societies across the world to be equipped to use quality and timely information to influence operations and planning in all emergencies including community epidemic outbreaks, all with the goal of being able to respond effectively to disasters.

GéoCameroon a Spatial Data Infrastructure based on OSM and easily transposable to other African countries, it brings together on a single platform all geographic georeferenced data of the country. For two decades in developed countries, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used by the government for their decision making. To carry out such policies, planning and management in Africa, the GIS tool can be of great help.
    This is especially true in an environment where collaborative models open new perspectives for the efficient production of geographic data. It is thus understood that the existence of a Spatial Data Infrastructure is essential to the implementation of location-based services.

  place: "CAVALLY"
  description: |
    The effects of climate change on water resources has led to increased water-stress in rural societies in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), with negative effects on humans, livestock and crop production. With low resource availability and long distances to permanent water sources, these societies are reliant on seasonal shallow ponds to satisfy both household and livestock water needs. Seasonal availability coupled with high siltation rates further increases the uncertainty in water availability in SSA. Earth observation (EO) coupled with technological advancement in feature detection through artificial intelligence (machine learning) provides the best way to map and monitor changes in water resources. However, cloud contamination and atmospheric interference limits the use of optical EO in water resources monitoring due to inconsistency in data availability, especially in the tropics. Active microwave sensing data especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with its all-day-and-night data acquisition solves the problem of data availability for continuous water resources monitoring. 
    Using SAR data with deep learning, we detect and map the location and availability of shallow water ponds to local communities and monitor their status. 
    This information in combination with weather data can be used e.g. for the preparation of food-security projects by international NGOs, prevention of human-wildlife conflicts caused by limited water resources or the creation of an early warning systems for water stress in local societies. 
    Using similar algorithms, object detection and mapping using imagery and deep learning is done by AfroAI UG, hence giving insight to location-based object.

The lives of students can be transformed in the sense that they don't need to ask questions on their way to certain places around their campus environment, maybe they are in search of a certain place with the help of the way-finder system. they can do that instead of getting stranded or go about following some unclear direction given to them by other people.

  place: "ABISSA"
  description: |
    This session describes the IT infrastructure underlying the community-run tourism initiative in Larabanga, in particular the FOSS tools for producing the web map and managing dataflows. The hallmark of this effort is absolutely minimizing the need for (1) writing -- and thus maintaining -- program code and (2) fully automating all data handling procedures by using advanced ETL tools. 
    This session will show how the information infrastructure for the town map -- the website centerpiece -- and other tourist information has been constructed. i.e. the software tools and dataflows implemented using QGIS/QGIS Server, Liz map, PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Pentaho DI (Community Edition) on Ubuntu. By reducing operational complexity, the aim is to simplify knowledge transfer to local participants and create sufficient expertise to stimulate ideas for re-use of the technology in future town projects.
    The dynamics of the community-run tourism project itself, carried out by the LECLARA collective in Larabanga, are described in an accompanying session (by Abusco Seidu) at this SOTM-Africa.

  place: "ABISSA"
  description: |
    In 2016, the collective LECLARA in rural Larabanga, Ghana decided to develop community-run tourism to generate funding for youth education. As a prerequisite, LECLARA has recently completed OSM mapping of the town. Activists are now using JOSM and MDC techniques. Hear how they are doing it all. Larabanga and its surrounding areas have a number of very significant tourist attractions.Until now, the town has benefited little from these. 
    With advisory support, an action plan was developed which began with mapping the town on OSM. Around this, a website and tourism materials will be produced. Activities (traditional storytelling and dance, local tours, etc.) will be organized by the community -- in particular, village youth -- while merchants can hope for increased revenue and local accommodations be made more attractive. 
    Despite the challenges (mobile Internet only, limited IT resources, lack of capital, etc.), with external support, Field Papers exchanges and hard work, an OSM map was ready by mid-2018. In August, OSM, JOSM and mobile data collection training began. By demonstrating success, LECLARA is increasingly able to mobilize support throughout the town and provide future perspectives for its residents.

Through my presentation i will also showcase how engaging the local communities in the participatory mapping sessions has impacted their long-term vision of the city and has brought a deeper sense of belonging to the habitants. How data collection has improved decision making and how the participatory mapping was used to update and complete the geographical data related to disaster risk management in priority areas. In addition, i will present the open source web GIS platform that was developed to facilitate data sharing and improve their use.

    Cet atelier vise à former les participants sur les techniques de collecte de données avec un fieldpapers, leur numérisation sur JOSM et leur récupération sur la plateforme overpass-turbo.        Les données géographiques sont d’une importance capitale surtout lorsqu’il s’agit de répondre à une crise humanitaire. Ainsi, la base de toute analyse spatiale d’un phénomène ou d’une épidémie est la disponibilité d’une information géographique précise et de qualité. Cependant le plus grand souci des agents de collecte, c’est la disponibilité de l’outil de collecte approprié. Les GPS et les smartphones de qualité peuvent être utiles mais sont chers et deviennent inefficaces lorsque la zone de collecte est vaste et surtout dans nos pays en voie de développement où la plupart des zones rurales n’ont pas accès à l’électricité. Les fieldpapers constituent de nos jours une alternative de choix pour répondre aux problèmes énergétiques et de cherté des outils de collecte que connaissent les agents de collecte. A travers cet atelier, les participants seront ouillés et pourront mieux répondre aux collectes de données et impacter ainsi les vies des populations en situation d'urgence.

    The power of drones and the demand for more detailed mapping in Africa has boomed in many sectors such as development, construction, flood prevention, humanitarian response and environmental safe guarding.  At Africa Bees we empower local pilots to use drones for the collection of geospatial data.        By recruiting and enabling pilots in Africa to use or own their own drones for the purpose of mapping we believe that the work can be carried our in-country at considerably lower costs yet retain the high levels of accuracy to produce engineering acceptable 3D topographic mapping. In addition the access to an open source geonode portal enables a community to share the geospatial data freely.

This talk will look back at these dynamics as well as views to strengthen a diverse, flat and open OSMF acting as an enabler for OSM in Africa         "The OSMF is subject of obvious attempts of entryism from some organizations, both within the OSMF board and its membership, trying collectively to modify drastically the governance of the OSM project, as the lobbying for the introduction of a code of conduct regulating all the exchanges between members of the OSM project on all medias (discussion lists, forums, tools, etc.) or the increasing place dedicated of corporate members. 
    This talk will aim at coming back to these topics, demonstrating their dangers for the governance of both the OSMF and the OSM project, as well as the uselessness and the ineffectiveness of these drastic changes yet presented as necessary by their proponents, and promoting the continuity of the flat, open and agile model that made the OSM project such a success. 
    It's important that these topics are discussed live in Africa by and with African mappers so that OSM keep going its way ""Transforming Lives through Mapping""!"

It has been some years that OSM and OMSF members have been discussing the topic of OSMF local chapters over emails, wiki, physically through BoF sessions at SotM events. This talk will share lessons that OSM and OSMF members can learn about the multi-years collective dynamics around OpenStreetMap which unfold in French-speaking southern countries of Africa and the Caribbean, where outreach, communication, mapping and training have been organized collectively from the start local OSM actions. These actions lead to first informal collective of mappers which organized internally over the years and for some incorporated as local associations mandated to the promotion and support of the OSM project playing the role of a de facto OSM Chapter. The talk will look at both these various collective practices and the OSMF requirements for local chapters in the light of this multi-years OSM associative experience with the view to identify itineraries to the building of OSMF local chapters.

    Tied to the overall support of the global OSM community and the commitment of Haitian and African mappers, these actions allowed the OSM project to come forth in the form of a network of organized and self-standing communities in Haiti, Western and Central Africa cognizant of and active with OpenStreetMap, open data and free geomatics.

An additional link between the OSM communities of Africa, South America where the film was shot, and Europe with its director and cyclist Alban Vivert. The film is made up of seven interviews with Latin American contributors who have decided to dedicate part of their time to the OpenStreetMap project. The objective of these interviews is to find out where their motivation to map on OSM comes from, why they do so and to what degree this has changed their lives or the lives of others who benefit from this map.

En  effet, le 2eme objectif du développement durable vise à: Éliminer la faim, assurer la sécurité alimentaire, améliorer la nutrition et promouvoir l'agriculture durable. Ceci explique le lien entre la ma thématique et le thème de la conférence.

      There is a growing recognition of the importance of data in achieving sustainable development. Without accurate and reliable data from a variety of sources, analysing the needs of a State and assessing the best measures to ensure sustainable development will be extremely challenging. Population growth, high unemployment rates and diminishing land availability necessitate increasingly sophisticated mechanisms for analysing demographic conditions. In this context, the coalition of geospatial data to aid in social and economic planning for development and to help inform decision making that will increase opportunities for creating jobs and attracting investment is essential.

      The FarmSense portal is an open source, public data repository for agricultural related geospatial reference datasets. Which was established to help meet the need of data for improved decision making.

    Water related tags are numerous in OpenStreetMap and, while water supply remains a key challenge in many places across Africa, we found relevant to organize a discussion about those tags: to clarify some of them, clear misuses or contradictions, and improve documentation adding the African context or nuances that is still missing in most wikipages on the subject.
   
    The result of this discussion is planned to eventually end on the tagging list to define a clearer and more usable standard data model and documentation, to facilitate data usage and therefore future data updates.

    - Panelist 1  (Erica Hagen, Map Kibera Trust, USA)

       In this interactive session, I will report on my research on sustainability of impact for OSM projects and organizations, conducted for Open Cities Africa with GFDRR at the World Bank. We will discuss challenges and tactics for sustaining mapping work and impact over time. Sustaining OSM mapping work and impacts of mapping projects can be a challenge. In order to truly transform lives, we need up to date data and sustained mapping. Many humanitarian and development oriented OSM mapping projects in Africa and elsewhere come and go dependent on short term goals, without a good plan for longer term impact of the map. Volunteers contribute but organized and comprehensive mapping of sectors like health, water, sanitation, education, and humanitarian sectors requires longer term sustainability. Achieving a stronger long-term impact will transform far more lives. This session will help participants think about challenges and tactics for sustaining the most important impacts of the great work they have been doing or want to do.

    "Map Kibera began 10 years ago, when young people from the Kibera slum of Nairobi put their community on OpenStreetMap. This session will discuss Map Kibera’s work over the past decade: where we started, obstacles and challenges along the way, accomplishments, and our vision for the future. 	For ten years, Map Kibera has worked with slumdwellers and other citizens to map their communities, and use open information for action and policy change. We always empower citizens to map their own communities, using OSM, discuss what they find, and engage policy makers and media to create local change. We have worked with themes like education, health and water to create maps that bring better services to slums like Kibera. Transforming lives by supporting community-driven mapping and use of open data has been our primary mission. Individual mappers trained in 2009 now lead the organization and train others throughout Kenya and beyond."

     We plan to talk about Apple's work mapping on OpenStreetMap throughout Africa, including how we’ve worked with the local community, what we've mapped, where we’ve mapped, what our procedures are and what tools and techniques we use, such as Atlas, MapRoulette and more.         "With a more complete and accurate road network, more local organizations, local businesses, governments and humanitarian organizations can use OSM and use it more effectively. Better road coverage ensures that remote areas are on the map, and that dense urban areas are properly reflected in maps. We use a variety of tools and plan to share how they work and how anyone can use them. More widespread tools and programs for finding and fixing map data issues also will let anyone else contribute and improve the map too for whatever their interest or purpose may be. We have also helped improve water features and coastlines in many areas, which can be important for flood and disaster preparedness, agriculture, transport and more.

    The session will introduce us to the new technological land developments and steer discussion
    about inclusion of various stakeholders. Land is central to development and technology can be a
    pillar in reviving the land information management systems.
    
    Secure land tenure is the certainty that one’s right to land is honored and protected. Land is
    central resource to development and if improperly managed, can hinder good governance and
    increase the vulnerability of persons to disaster and environmental degradation. Without secure
    tenure, economies cannot progress and the goal of sustainable development cannot be realized.
    ‘Fit-for-purpose’ land mapping is a current valuable approach indicating that an efficient system
    and the underlying spatial framework of large-scale mapping can be designed for the purpose of
    managing current land issues within a specific region. Benefits relating to this approach relate to
    a complete and coherent land cadastre within a relatively short time at aﬀordable costs but
    importantly the participatory processes with the concerned communities. Many Land parcels
    have been mapped land rights have been ascertained for communities. Hence, there is the need to
    gleam on such kind of sustainable mapping approach.

  place: "COMOE"
  description: |
    In many places with young OSM communities, quality analysis seems to be mainly done through tasking manager remote validators, with still very little local "Data gardening". Why should we care about data quality? And how to do it practically and still have some fun? Quality control is crucial and highly necessary in about all mapping projects that intend to transform lives. If a well-intentioned project produces a very high amount of bad quality data, it can actually do more harm than good. First because the data can simply be unusable by the targeted users (for instance during emergency mapping in activations). Second because it might require much more time to correct it than it would have taken to trace it correctly in the first place. Third because it can also affect the reputation of the database and mappers.
        
    But spending time on quality control/analysis and corrections isn't only good for the data, it also helps mappers to develop their own skills. Crowdmapping is sometimes seen as something too easy and simple. This session intends to show you some ways in which you could deepen and broaden your skills. And therefore how mapping can change a little bit of your own life.
